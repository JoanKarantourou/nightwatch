# NightWatch — Roadmap

## Milestones
- Repo + CI scaffold in place
- Local dev stack up (`docker-compose.dev`)
- First end-to-end flow (ingest → process → display)
- Observability wired (traces/metrics/logs) with a basic dashboard
- K8s packaging (Helm) and cloud-ready IaC skeleton (Terraform)

> Detailed planning is tracked internally.
